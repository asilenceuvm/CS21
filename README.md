# CS21

This is the final project I created for my CS 021 class, written in python.
It uses the Response, and BeautifulSoup libraries to load and scrape random wikipedia pages for their character count and  views in the past 60 days.
It saves that data into a text file, as a list of ordered pairs.
It also has a graphing function using matplotlib, and numpy to plot each pair into a scatter plot.
